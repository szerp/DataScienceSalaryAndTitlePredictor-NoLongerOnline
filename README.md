# Project Title - Data Science Salary and Title Predictor

Developed a predictive model to accurately forecast job titles and salaries based on user input, leveraging machine learning algorithms and data preprocessing techniques. The project involved applying Python programming skills for data manipulation, feature engineering, and model training. Additionally, the model was deployed using web development technologies, enhancing its accessibility to users. This project was conducted within the AI4ALL Apply AI program, providing a structured framework and mentorship to explore real-world applications of artificial intelligence.

## Problem Statement <!--- do not change this line -->
The current job market is characterized by a high degree of complexity, with job seekers often facing challenges in accurately predicting their potential job titles and expected salaries based on their qualifications and experience. Existing job search platforms may not always provide reliable or personalized recommendations, leading to frustration and inefficiency in the job search process. To address this issue, there is a need for a robust predictive model that can accurately predict job titles and salaries based on user input, providing job seekers with personalized recommendations to streamline their job search process.

## Key Results <!--- do not change this line -->
- User-Friendly Interface: The web application interface was designed to be intuitive and user-friendly, allowing users to easily input their information and receive personalized recommendations without encountering any usability issues.
- Dynamic Form Elements: Implementation of dynamic form elements using JavaScript enhanced the interactivity of the web application, providing a smooth and responsive user experience.
- Robust Deployment: The web application was successfully deployed on Heroku, ensuring reliable access for users over the internet. The deployment process was smooth and without any major issues, ensuring the application's availability.
- Professional Disclaimer: A professional disclaimer was incorporated into the application, highlighting the potential limitations of the predictions, especially with higher years of experience, to manage user expectations effectively.
- *Accurate Predictions: The predictive model developed in this project consistently provided accurate predictions of job titles and salaries based on user input. However, currently, I am unable to verify the accuracy of the models statistically due to some errors encountered in the terminal.
  - I used alternative testing methods to check:
   - That increasing/decreasing years of experience would impact salary (Image A). The results showed it did.
   - Whether or not coastal cities had higher salaries than remote jobs or jobs in Florida (Image B). The results showed that Remote and Florida salaries were higher - this is most likely due to the data set being small.
   - Whether the salary would be realistic (Image C). It worked, but when it comes to someone having 20+ years of experience, the salary increased exponentially and unrealistically.

## Methodologies <!--- do not change this line -->

For this project, we employed a combination of machine learning and web development methodologies to create a web application that predicts job titles and salaries based on user input.

1. **Machine Learning Methodologies**:
   - Utilized scikit-learn, a powerful machine learning library in Python, to train and deploy a predictive model. 
   - Employed supervised learning techniques to train the model on a labeled dataset containing job-related features such as location, skills, and years of experience, along with corresponding job titles and salaries.
   - Preprocessed the dataset by handling missing values, encoding categorical variables, and scaling numerical features to ensure optimal model performance.
   - Experimented with different machine learning algorithms such as decision trees, random forests, and gradient boosting to identify the most suitable model for the task.
   - Evaluated model performance using metrics such as mean absolute error (MAE) and mean squared error (MSE) to assess prediction accuracy.

2. **Web Development Methodologies**:
   - Leveraged Flask, a lightweight web framework in Python, to develop the backend of the web application.
   - Designed a clean and intuitive user interface using HTML and CSS to enhance user experience.
   - Implemented dynamic form elements to collect user input such as location, skills, and years of experience.
   - Integrated JavaScript to enhance interactivity, such as handling form submissions and displaying prediction results without page reloads.
   - Deployed the web application using Heroku, a cloud platform as a service (PaaS), to make it accessible to users over the internet.

Overall, the project involved a combination of data preprocessing, model training, web development, and deployment techniques to create an end-to-end solution for predicting job titles and salaries based on user input.
